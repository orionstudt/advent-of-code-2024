For day `01`:

```shell
$ ruby ./day-01/program.rb example
List 1 length = 6
List 2 length = 6
Current Distance = 0
Current Distance 0 = 2 + 2 (1 - 3)
Current Distance 1 = 3 + 1 (2 - 3)
Current Distance 2 = 3 + 0 (3 - 3)
Current Distance 3 = 4 + 1 (3 - 4)
Current Distance 4 = 6 + 2 (3 - 5)
Current Distance 5 = 11 + 5 (4 - 9)
Total Distance = 11
Similarity Score = 31
